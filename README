This is a project in the works let me know what I can make better.

In the menu admin screen:

1. Create a menu item and save it. ( do not add the $ or () )
2. Open the item and enter the name of your conditional in the conditional field.
3. Save the menu.

On the front end we do it like this (must come after the menu at this time):

	<?php wp_nav_menu('nav'); ?>
	<?php global $is_mypage; //your conditional would have been is_mypage ?>
	<?php if($is_mypage): ?>
			<?="this is my page"; ?>
			<div>Super fancy time.</div>
	<?php endif; ?>
	
	<?php global $a_post;  //your conditional would have been a_post ?>
	<?php if($a_post): ?>
			<?= "this is my post";?>
	<?php endif; ?>
